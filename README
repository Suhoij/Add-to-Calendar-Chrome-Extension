This is a simple Chrome Extension that allows users to highlight dates on a webpage and then easily add them to Google Calendar.

Here is a list of to do items I'm currently working on adding:

- redesign it to make it work on Chrome for Windows (needs to be wider)
- fix regexs for short month codes like Jan, Feb, etc
- allow user to select from their various Google Calendars
